"This is the publicly available code for the article 'Innovative Combination of Covariance Analysis-based Sliding Time Window and Task-related Component Analysis for Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential Recognition'. The sample data is denoted as 's18', and the channels have already been processed (40*9*1500*6). After loading the data, the data name displayed on Matlab should be 'a'. Note that the Wp and Ws of filterbank in this version are Wp = [passband(idx_fb)/fs, 70/fs] and Ws = [stopband(idx_fb)/fs, 80/fs] respectively. The results in the paper are obtained with Wp = [passband(idx_fb)/fs, 90/fs] and Ws = [stopband(idx_fb)/fs, 100/fs].
